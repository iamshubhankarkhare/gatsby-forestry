  heading: Customizing the GraphQL Schema
  subtitle: One of Gatsby’s main strengths is the ability to query data from a variety
    of sources in a uniform way with GraphQL. For this to work, a GraphQL Schema must
    be generated that defines the shape of the data.
  body: Gatsby is able to automatically infer a GraphQL Schema from your data, and
    in many cases, this is really all you need. There are however situations when
    you either want to explicitly define the data shape, or add custom functionality
    to the query layer - this is what Gatsby’s Schema Customization API provides.
