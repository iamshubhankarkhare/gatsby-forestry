  heading: Customizing the GraphQL Schema
  subtitle: One of Gatsby’s main strengths is the ability to query data from a variety
    of sources in a uniform way with GraphQL. For this to work, a GraphQL Schema must
    be generated that defines the shape of the data.
  body: Gatsby is able to automatically infer a GraphQL Schema from your data, and
    in many cases, this is really all you need. There are however situations when
    you either want to explicitly define the data shape, or add custom functionality
    to the query layer - this is what Gatsby’s Schema Customization API provides.

  subtitle: The example project is a blog that gets its data from local Markdown files
    which provide the post contents, as well as author information in JSON format.
    There are also occasional guest contributors whose info is kept in a separate
    JSON file.

      Node interface, which describes the set of fields common to node objects created
      by source and transformer plugins (id, parent, children, as well as a couple
      of internal fields like type). In GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL),
      it looks like this:'
